Assignment#1 Algorithm

The purpose of this program is to prompt the user for a word and use a single recursive function to invert the word. The first step is to create a main function which is responsible for running the program. The user is then asked for a word using the printf and the word is stored in a char array which contains 99 characters. Next, the length of userWord is determined using strlen and that value is stored in int size. A separate function is created to invert the string of characters called void reversedWord, and information obtained from main function is passed to this function (index value, char array for userWord, and size of string). This function is called in the next step of the main function. In the void reverseWord function, a temp char is created. The first and last characters/letters are reversed, then characters/letters inside. Finally the reversedWord is passed back to main function and this is displayed to user using printf. Finally, the user is asked if they want to reverse another word. If the input is “N” then “Thank you! Goodbye” will be displayed. If the input is “Y” then the code will start over again at the code that starts with “start.”
